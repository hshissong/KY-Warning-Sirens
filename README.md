# KY-Warning-Sirens
mapping known locations of outdoor warning sirens in Kentucky

Add this info into paragraphs, make it look nicer

Who: Hannah Hissong for University of Kentucky
When: February-March 2025

What:a map showing known locations of outdoor warning sirens in the Commonwealth of Kentucky with buffers around them to represent how much of the state is reasonably able to hear these sirens when they are set off
Why: according to the government of Boone County, Missouri (https://www.showmeboone.com/oem/resources/sirens.asp) outdoor warning sirens can reliably be heard at a distance of one mile
How:

Cody Ashbaugh at Louisville Metro Emergency Services supplied additional data for Jefferson, Shelby, Bullitt, Spencer, and Oldham counties. Many thanks to him for this work!

many sirens for smaller towns or rural counties write out a description of the location on a website such as: "Danville Fire Department Station 1 (Main Street)". While this information is helpful for local residents who go searching for that specific information, it is not helpful for a statewide or national initiative or database. Collecting all written locations like this across the state of Kentucky was outside the scope of realistic work to take on for this project but would make an excellent research project and case for further study.

Some lists are managed by cities but most appear to be managed by counties. Some local National Weather Service offices keep a list of sirens they know about but most just include general information about the use of sirens. Sirens are not set off remotely by a national or even local network. Instead most of them are set off singularly leading to a host of problems. A county official can set of the "tornado siren" when there is no threat of tornado, triggering local anxiety. This can also be used as a great tool to alert for local dangers that may not otherwise be tracked. Because sirens are not set off as a group, there has been no need to assemble a database of their locations across a state or the entire nation. Most are managed by the county emergency response teams which is why most of the listings seem to be managed by counties. 

Additionally data around large urban centers proved easier to locate and use while data for more rural locations was impossible to locate. 

Must include:
Project title
Information about data sources
Link to data sources where applicable, or a copy of the full data source for download
Markdown formatting throughout the document
Description of why you created the map
Description of how the map was created, including any geoprocessing methods or other steps you took, described in a way that someone else could recreate your map process in a new location
Active link to the final index.html page
Include embedded images, as needed, to document the mapping process, including key data management or geoprocessing steps and settings
Information about the projection of the final map

 The README.md file will be visualized at the pathway following the pattern *https://github.com/username/repository-name*

 The index.html file will be visualized at *https://username.github.io/repository-name*. 

 You will need to create links on each page that links to the other page. For example, creating a link on the README.md file that takes the viewer to the index.html page.
